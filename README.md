# GitHub Asset Management Toolkit

  ghAMT allows you to control the lifecycle of a package or other asset generated by a build.

  Continuous Integration systems can be configured to, as part of the build process, generate a set of assets (such as binary packages). These are stored at the Github servers under the designation of "Releases".

  ghAMT aims to arm you with a set of tools to automatically check if your installable packages comply to your standards.

## Installation

Install it with:

    $ gem install ghamt


Or, add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'ghamt'

and then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

ghamt --current [COMMIT_ID]

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
